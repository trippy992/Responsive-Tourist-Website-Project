            <h3>Independence Square</h3>

Located at the head of the monument is the statue of the first prime minister of the country, Rt. Hon. Don Stephen Senanayake; ‘The Father of the Nation’.

                The Independence Square served as the ceremonial assembly hall for the Senate of Ceylon and the House of Representatives of Ceylon until the parliament was moved to the new parliament complex. Currently, it is the venue for religious events and annual national day celebrations. It is also the perfect pitstop for some peace in the bustling city.</span>
