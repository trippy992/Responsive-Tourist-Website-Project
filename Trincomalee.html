            <img src="image/Fort Frederick, Trincomalee.jpg" alt="">
            <h3> Fort Frederick, Trincomalee</h3>
            <span class="desc">In the coastal town of Trincomalee is the beautiful Fort Frederick which was built in the 17th century by the Portuguese and was later fully completed by the year 1624. The Fort has an exciting appeal to it as it was built on the Swami Rock-Konamamala which was formed by the debris and remains of the famous Hindu Koneswaram temple, which was also known as a temple of a thousand pillars.

                The Sri Lankan army is currently operating the Fort, but it also acts as an alluring tourist destination which attracts people due to its historical appeal. One can explore the Fort on foot or hire a tuk-tuk. Inside the Fort, you will also come across the Gokana Temple and the Wellesley Lodge among other historical imprints. Thus, the Fort takes you on a fantastic heritage experience to remember.</span>

            <h3>Koneswaram Temple</h3>
            <span class="desc">The Koneswaram temple is one of the main highlights of the east coast of Sri Lanka in Trincomalee. The temple is located high above the bay, and you can view the breathtaking and awe-inspiring scenery on all sides. The site is a religious pilgrimage for the Hindus and is also known as the Kailasa of the South. The Koneswaram temple is one of the five “Pancha Ishwarams” (abodes of Shiva) which has been built to worship Lord Shiva- the supreme God of Hinduism.

                The original construction of the temple dates back to 400 B.C.E., later to the 5th century and finally to the 18th century. The temple’s complex was considered to be one of the most ancient combinations of architecture and ornamentation. The original temple had beautiful features of a thousand pillared hall and a raised platform which was later destroyed. Koneswaram gets its name from the chief deity of the temple that is God Shiva, who is also known as someone who reigns over the mountains. The name ‘Konam’ is believed to have come from the Old Tamil word meaning ‘peak’. 
                
                The restoration work of the temple was completed by the year 1963, with many of the old pieces being reinstalled. Although the temple does not match up to the grandeur as the ancient times, it remains a favourite place of visit for both Hindus as well as non-Hindus. The journey for pilgrims in the town begins at the opening of Konesar Road and follows a path through courtyard shrines of the compound to the deities Bhadrakali, Ganesh, Vishnu Thirumal, Surya, Raavana, Ambal-Shakti, Murukan and Shiva who preside at the peninsula’s height.</span>

            <h3>Kanniya Hot Springs</h3>
            <span class="desc">The Kanniya Hot Springs is on the east coast of Sri Lanka in Trincomalee and includes a series of seven square shaped wells each with a depth of about four feet. The temperature of the water at these hot springs varies between wells, but the average temperature is warm to hot. These hot springs are an example of nature in its purest form where the water from the well is believed to have healing properties. The water in each of the wells is not very deep, and one can see the bottom of the well. The depth of the well is such that the water will run out by drawing 10-15 buckets from it.

                The legend of the Kanniya Hot Springs dates back to more than 5000 years ago when Ravana was the ruler of Sri Lanka. It is a belief that he raised his sword in anger in several parts of the Earth which has later emerged into the hot springs. The hot springs get the name ‘Kanniya’ after his mother. The wells were also considered as an ancient site used for cleaning and purification by the Buddhist. The Mari Amman Kovil now maintains the wells in collaboration with the authorities of the Sri Lankan military. </span>
